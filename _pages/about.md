I'm a junior data scientist, with a strong background in mathematical modeling, and a driven interest in machine learning and statistical data analysis.

I hold a BSc and a PhD in Theoretical Physics, obtained from Imperial College London and University of Southern California, respectively. My academic research was focused on String Theory and Quantum Field Theory.
